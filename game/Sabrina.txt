You are Maelegant. You are on the Evil team. 

kevin is a fellow member of the evil council.

Ability: Reversal 
You are able to play Reversal cards while on missions. A Reversal card inverts the result of a mission; a mission that would have succeeded now fails and vice versa. 
 
Note: In games with at least 7 players, a Reversal played on the 4th mission results in a failed mission if there is only one Fail card, and otherwise succeeds. Reversal does not interfere with Agravaine's ability to cause the mission to fail.
